# Pool Concentration Calculator
This project calculates the required dilution factor (the "Amount to Take") for DNA/RNA samples based on their measured concentration and a set of target "pool" concentrations.

This solution fulfills the Day03 assignment requirements, including the separation of the basic code, testing, and documentation of third-party library use.

## Project Structure

Basic_code_Assignment.py: Contains the core calculation function.

PoolCalculatorApp.py: The main application runner, providing GUI, CLI, interactive modes, and a dedicated test runner.

test_calculations.py: Pytest unit tests for validating the business logic.

Qubit_data_example.csv: Sample data file for testing the application.

requirements.txt: Lists all required Python packages for easy installation.

## Prompts I used:
### AI used: Gemini
Make testing functions using pytest for the provided code (pasted the Basic_code and the calculator app) and add a testing function to the original calculator app.
The tests should be in a file called test_calculations.py that can be called upon using pytest.
