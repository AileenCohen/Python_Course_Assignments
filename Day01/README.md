To do the assignment (the website), I used Copilot.
The prompts:
1. I'm making a GitHub page using Markdown, and I would like to style it with pastel colors and some floating bubbles in the background. 
   What would be the best way to do that?
(Provided a CSS solution)
2. How do I make my profile picture smaller?
